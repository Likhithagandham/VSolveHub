# VSolveHub ΓÇö Quick Service Hub

**VSolveHub** is a public marketing and booking website for an India-focused doorstep services marketplace. Customers browse eight service categories, open individual service pages, and submit enquiries. The UI is designed for first-time smartphone users in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities — large touch targets, minimal forms, and a mobile-first coral theme.

This repository contains the **customer-facing website** only. Job opportunities and worker onboarding live in a separate app (not in this repo).

## Data layer

All service data lives in **`lib/data.ts`**, migrated from the original `data.js` spreadsheet catalogs.

**Key exports:**

- `CATEGORIES` ΓÇö nine category definitions
- `SERVICES` ΓÇö flat array of all bookable services (~1,072 items)
- `getCategory`, `getServiceById`, `getServicesByCategory`, `getSubCategories`
- `FAQ_DATA`, `GALLERY_ITEMS`, `TESTIMONIALS`
- `saveBooking`, `getBooking`, `isReturningUser`, `markUserRegistered`
- `getWhatsAppUrl`, contact constants

**Service object shape:**

```ts
{
  id: number;
  name: string;
  subCategory: string;
  price: string;
  description: string;
  category: string;
  icon: string;
}
```

To add or edit services, update the relevant `*_CATALOG` array in `lib/data.ts` and rebuild.

---

## Design system

Visual design follows **`DESIGN.md`** ΓÇö a minimalist e-commerce-inspired system:

| Token | Value | Usage |
|-------|-------|-------|
| `bg-cream` | `#FFF1F0` | Page background |
| `accent` | `#FD4C4A` | CTAs, action buttons |
| `accent-dark` | `#8B2E2C` | Hover states, heroes |
| `text-primary` | `#1A0A0A` | Body and headings |
| `footer-dark` | `#3A1514` | Footer background |

- **Typography:** Roboto (mobile-first, Google Stitch style)
- **Layout:** Bottom nav, card UI, single-column mobile shell
- **Touch targets:** minimum 48├ù48px
- **Spacing:** 8px base grid
- **Components:** category cards, sub-service cards, filter pills, enquiry forms, booking timeline

---

## Deployment

The app is a standard Next.js project and deploys to any platform that supports Node.js:

**Vercel (recommended)**

```bash
pnpm build
# Connect the GitHub repo in Vercel ΓÇö framework preset: Next.js
```

**Node server**

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

Set the start command to `pnpm start` and the build command to `pnpm install && pnpm build`. Ensure **pnpm** is available in the build environment (Corepack or global install).

No environment variables are required for the current demo. When connecting a real backend, you will likely need API URLs and WhatsApp/contact configuration.

---

## Legacy static site

The original HTML + vanilla JS implementation is preserved in **`legacy/`** for reference. It is not served by Next.js. All active routes use the App Router paths documented above.
